    <h1>Key Areas of Property Law Relevant to Landlord & Tenant Surveying</h1>
    <p class="muted">Understanding the legal framework that underpins commercial landlord and tenant relationships is essential for property professionals and anyone involved in managing, owning, or occupying commercial premises. Several Acts of Parliament set out rights, responsibilities, and procedures governing notices, repairs, alterations, assignments, and the renewal or termination of leases. The following is a clear overview of the main legislation encountered in day-to-day surveying and property management work.</p>

    <h2>1. Law of Property Act 1925 – Service of Notices and Forfeiture</h2>
    <p>The Law of Property Act 1925 remains a cornerstone of English property law, and several sections are particularly relevant to landlord and tenant matters.</p>
    <h3>Section <span class="nolink">62</span></h3>
    <p>Certain rights—such as easements—can automatically pass with the sale or grant of a lease. Landlords often exclude <span class="nolink">s.62</span> to avoid unintentionally granting additional rights.</p>
    <h3>Section <span class="nolink">146</span></h3>
    <p>Governs the service of forfeiture notices for breaches other than non-payment of rent. Notices must include the breach, remedy, timescale, and any compensation. For rent arrears, landlords may use CRAR or peaceable re-entry instead.</p>
    <h3>Section <span class="nolink">147</span></h3>
    <p>Relevant to repairs and dilapidations, dealing with tenant relief in certain circumstances.</p>
    <h3>Section <span class="nolink">196</span></h3>
    <p>Sets out how notices must be served. Valid service occurs if left at the tenant’s last known address. Recorded delivery is recommended, as proof of service is required.</p>

    <h2>2. Landlord and Tenant Act 1927 – Alterations, Improvements and Dilapidations</h2>
    <h3>Section <span class="nolink">18</span></h3>
    <p>Caps terminal dilapidations claims to the diminution in value (difference between property in repair and disrepair), preventing disproportionate claims.</p>
    <h3>Section <span class="nolink">3</span></h3>
    <p>Tenants wishing to carry out improvements must give notice referencing their statutory rights. Landlords have two months to respond and may carry out works themselves or allow the tenant to claim compensation.</p>
    <h3>Alterations</h3>
    <p>Viewed as improvements from the tenant’s perspective. Tenants may seek court permission even if lease prohibits works. Landlords must act reasonably but damages for refusal are not automatic.</p>
    <p>Section <span class="nolink">19(1)(a)</span> converts qualified covenants to fully qualified, ensuring landlords cannot unreasonably withhold consent.</p>

    <h2>3. Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 – Security of Tenure and Lease Renewals</h2>
    <h3>Section <span class="nolink">24</span></h3>
    <p>Protected business tenancies continue automatically after expiry until formally ended.</p>
    <h3>Section <span class="nolink">24A</span></h3>
    <p>Allows interim rent applications within six months of expiry, usually alongside <span class="nolink">s.25</span> or <span class="nolink">s.26</span> notices.</p>
    <h3>Sections <span class="nolink">25–27</span></h3>
    <p>Define notices for termination or request of new tenancy, including opposition periods and required minimum notice.</p>
    <h3>Sections <span class="nolink">28–31A</span></h3>
    <p>Set out renewals by agreement or court order, grounds for opposition, and conditions for dismissal or granting of a new tenancy.</p>
    <h3>New Lease Terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>s.32: property included</li>
      <li>s.33: lease term (up to 15 years if court imposes)</li>
      <li>s.34: rent determination (O’May v City of London)</li>
      <li>s.35: other terms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Section <span class="nolink">37</span>: compensation for opposition on certain grounds; Section <span class="nolink">38</span>: contracting out; Section <span class="nolink">40</span>: tenant information obligations.</p>

    <h2>4. Landlord and Tenant Act 1988 – Assignments and Reasonableness</h2>
    <p>Reinforces landlord duty to act reasonably regarding assignments and consents. Landlords may require tenants to cover reasonable costs.</p>
    <p>Reasonable response times are judged from tenant’s perspective. Unreasonable withholding allows tenant to proceed (with risk) or seek a court declaration. Damages are possible for unreasonable refusal on assignments but not alterations.</p>
    <p>Landlords may only rely on objections given in writing within the reasonable time frame. Examples of unreasonable behaviour include collateral advantage or unconsented alterations without justification.</p>

    <h2>5. Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 – Post-1996 Leases</h2>
    <p>Abolished privity of contract for leases from 1 January 1996. Once a lease is assigned, the original tenant is generally released from liability.</p>
    <p>For older leases, landlords must notify former tenants or guarantors of breaches. AGAs are only enforceable if permitted by the lease. Section <span class="nolink">17</span>: arrears notice must be served within six months. Case law prevents assignment to a tenant’s own guarantor (House of Fraser).</p>

    <h2>6. Leasehold Property Repairs Act 1938 – Restrictions on Enforcement of Repairs</h2>
    <p>Restricts landlord forfeiture for disrepair where leases are at least seven years and more than three years remain. Statutory procedures must be followed before enforcement.</p>
